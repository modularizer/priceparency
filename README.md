# Priceparency
Pavilions Price Transparency Project

Goal is to show the price of Pavilions recipes in a browsable way.


## How to run the project
Right now, the project source code needs to be run in the developer console while on the Pavilions website.
To come, there will be a way to click a bookmarklet to run the code, and maybe even a browser extension.
